Coding example for auctionata coding task describet in file:
auctionata-coding-exercise.md

Basicly this is an auction house webapp.
I've decided to focus on the frontend scope.
Development was done in JetBrains Webstorm. I also used the buildin webserver to test.

Installation:
1. get all files and folders
2. launch with a localhost web server, tested in firefox and chrome, firefox works also without a web server

Testing:
- launch with index.html
- i've attached green (lime) colored labels marking the scenarios/tasks mentioned in the document "auctionata-coding-exercise.md".
- after launching the index.html you are in the auction room, already logged in as a user
- the auction lasts for 20 sec (countdown displayed on top right)
- to re-start auction simplay hit F5/reload page
- to check scenario 1-3 you can simply use the ui (commit a bid-button) in the auction room
- to check scenario 4 you can use the marked button in the upper part of the webapp - I've called it "Debugging btns"

Kind regards
